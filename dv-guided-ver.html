                        <h3>MARCH 15, ONE MONTH AGO</h3>
						<p>Russia had the city surrounded, 
                            cutting off supply lines for Ukranian troops.
                            <br><br>
                            Seizing Mariupol is crucial for Russia. The
                            city occupies a strategic location 
                            between Crimea, which Russia annexed 
                            in 2014, and areas of the Donbas region 
                            in eastern Ukraine that are controlled by 
                            Russia-backed separatists. If Russia 
                            takes control of the city, troops fighting 
                            there could be redeployed to Donbas, 
                            which is now Russia&#8217s central focus in 
                            the war.
                        </p>

                        <h3>MARCH 28, TWO WEEKS AGO</h3>
						<p>Russian forces had advanced toward the city
                            center on multiple fronts (from the north, east, and west.)
                            <br><br>
                            Despite being outnumbered, Ukrainian troops 
                            continue to hold some key areas of Mariupol. 
                            Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, the commander in chief of 
                            Ukraine&#8217s armed forces, said on Facebook on 
                            Monday that Ukrainian forces were continuing to 
                            “hold the city, durably and sustainably,” but given 
                            <b>recent Russian gains, analysts at the Institute for 
                            the Study of War, a Washington research group, 
                            believe that Russian forces are likely to capture 
                            Mariupol in the coming week.</b>
                        </p>

                        <h3>APRIL 12, NOW</h3>
						<p> April 12 Russian troops had divided the city, splitting Ukrainian forces.
                            <br><br>
                            Mariupol has been under siege by Russian forces for more than 40 days. 
                            Civilians who remain in the city lack access to water, food or electricity, 
                            and they face almost constant aerial bombardment. Almost no area of 
                            the city has been left unscathed, according to an analysis of satellite 
                            imagery by Masae Analytics, a company that assesses damage to buildings.
