                        <h3>MARCH 15, ONE MONTH AGO</h3>
						<p>Russia had the city surrounded, 
                            cutting off supply lines for Ukranian troops.

                            Seizing Mariupol is crucial for Russia. The
                            city occupies a strategic location 
                            between Crimea, which Russia annexed 
                            in 2014, and areas of the Donbas region 
                            in eastern Ukraine that are controlled by 
                            Russia-backed separatists. If Russia 
                            takes control of the city, troops fighting 
                            there could be redeployed to Donbas, 
                            which is now Russia&#8217s central focus in 
                            the war.

                        <h3>MARCH 28, TWO WEEKS AGO</h3>
						<p>Russian forces had advanced toward the city
                            center on multiple fronts (from the north, east, and west.)
                            <br><br>
                            Despite being outnumbered, Ukrainian troops 
                            continue to hold some key areas of Mariupol. 
                            Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, the commander in chief of 
                            Ukraine&#8217s armed forces, said on Facebook on 
                            Monday that Ukrainian forces were continuing to 
                            “hold the city, durably and sustainably,” but <b>given 
                            recent Russian gains, analysts at the Institute for 
                            the Study of War, a Washington research group, 
                            believe that Russian forces are likely to capture 
                            Mariupol in the coming week.</b>

                        <h3>APRIL 12, NOW</h3>
						<p> April 12 Russian troops had divided the city, splitting Ukrainian forces.
                            <br><br>
                            Mariupol has been under siege by Russian forces for more than 40 days. 
                            Civilians who remain in the city lack access to water, food or electricity, 
                            and they face almost constant aerial bombardment. Almost no area of 
                            the city has been left unscathed, according to an analysis of satellite 
                            imagery by Masae Analytics, a company that assesses damage to buildings.

        <p>
            Below is a map visualizing a more detailed look at
            Russia strengthening its grip on Ukraine.
            Highlighted areas show estimates of large changes 
            in the shapes of buildings using radar data and 
            satellite imagery taken on Feb. 20 and April 5.
            <i>(All data is from the New York Times.</i>
        </p>
        <img src="media/summary.png" class="summary">
        <h3 class="end">Write-Up</h2>
        <p>
            I redesigned the second set of map visualizations from 
            <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/world/europe/ukraine-maps.html">
            an article by the New York Times regarding the Russia-Ukraine War.</a>
            The maps I am referring to are from <i>"April 13, 2022 - Russia tightens its grip on Mariupol."</i>
            Many maps included in the NYT's coverage of the Russia-Ukraine War lack 
            interactivity, animations, and storytelling, which I think would really 
            improve the communication of their coverage. (The maps contain a lot of information, 
            and presenting a static map does little to help the viewer process the sides 
            involved in the war as well as physical positionings.) For the maps I chose specifically, 
            when I first came across the 3 different maps of Ukraine, I could not 
            help but wonder why the NYT chose 3 different maps in a time series of the same city. 
            Would it not have been more compelling to show the <b>progression</b> of Russian forces 
            in a such a key Ukranian city on the same map or an animation? As such, some 
            ideas I first brainstormed was a map similar to Charles Minard's of Napoleon's 
            failed invasion. I was also thinking of an interactive slider that would show the 
            progression of Russian forces into Mariupol. <br><br>
            In the end, after an email conversation with Professor Swinehart, I decided to create a 
            scrollytelling story with the same visualizations from the NYT. By combining the maps
            from March 15 to April 12 into a scrolltelling story, users can now directly and more 
            easily see the advance of Russian troops into Mariupol, rather than having to compare 
            3 unfamiliar maps side-by-side. Coupled with text/descriptions, it becomes 
            very clear that Russian forces may very well take control of the 
            key Ukranian city soon.
